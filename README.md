# Hypothesis-Testing-Easy-to-understand-
We will conduct hypothesis testing on annual salaries of employees over the period of 3 years.

1. We have payroll data for employees for a period of 3 years.
2. We will be conducting Z and T test to check if annual salary for employees have increased from 2015 to 2016 or not.
3. We will then accept/reject the hypothesis based on test stats and check for type I/II error.
4. In the end we will conduct ANOVA test to see if base pay of electricians have changed over the period of 3 years or not.
